Welcome to the Introduction Challenge!

It's not very much a challenge, but rather a way for you to test the whole process. Just copy the flag you will find in the file 'flag.txt' into the flag server, as indicated on Canvas, et voila!

If it's not working, please either a question on Discourse or bring it up during the practicas.
